# Robust Modelling and Prediction for Noisy Time Series

In this project we implement a robust version of the Sequence VAE from [Bowman et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06349), used to model a clean signal corrupted by noise. 

The code in this repository is used and cited in my dissertation for the MRes programme in Computational Statistics and Machine Learning at UCL, with David Barber as supervisor.
